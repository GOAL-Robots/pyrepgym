**INSTALLATION DRAFT**

Download all install&lt;something&gt;.sh files from the demo_install directory.  
Put them in your home directory (other locations not tested).  
Delete the pyrepgym repository if you downloaded the whole repository, this will be automatically downloaded and installed later.  

Execute:  
./installPyRep.sh  
./installREAL.sh  
./installROS.sh  

You may need to open a new terminal between running each install file.
